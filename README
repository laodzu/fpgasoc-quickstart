SD card creation
----------------

This directory contains all files neccessary to generate the SD card
used in the EBV SoCrates evaluation kits.  On a GNU/Linux system,
attach an SD card and call the mk-sd-card.sh script to create the
whole image:

[dzu@pet socrates-training]$ ./mk-sd-card.sh 
usage: ./mk-sd-card.sh [device]
       device - block device file of sd-card
                (e.g. /dev/sdb or /dev/mmcblk0)
[dzu@pet socrates-training]$ ./mk-sd-card.sh /dev/sdb

Note that for this to work reliably, no partitions of the SD card must
be mounted at that time.  Be especially aware of this if you use desktop
environments like GNOME that automount all media that gets attached.

The script will re-create a new partition table with two partitions
and populate them:

1 - Preloader image
2 - socrates-training root filesystem complete with small examples

Default bootup
--------------

U-Boot is setup to boot the kernel+dtb from the Linux partition (below
/boot), so insert the SD card and apply power.  The board will come up
with a default IP address of 192.168.42.5.

Boot via tftp and NFS
---------------------

When you have a working tftp/NFS setup on 192.168.42.20, then you can
boot into kernel+dtb from tftp and into the rootfs by running

  run net_nfs

Tuning of ip addresses, file names and rootpath is easily done by
adjusting U-Boot environment variables, i.e. to load
"uImage-development" instead of "uImage", one can do

  setenv bootfile uImage-development
  run net_nfs

Resetting the environment
-------------------------

If there is the need to reset the environment quickly, then one can
use the prepared "adjust-env.scr" U-Boot script:

  ext2load mmc 0:2 0x100000 boot/adjust-env.scr
  source 0x100000
  saveenv

Debian 8 root filesystem
------------------------

The root filesystem is a standard Debian 8 armv7a-hf installation.
